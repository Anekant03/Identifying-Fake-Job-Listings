# Identifying-Fake-Job-Listings

#Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to detect fake job postings based on a variety of features extracted from job descriptions. The notebook leverages advanced techniques in data preprocessing and machine learning, culminating in a robust classification model to distinguish between genuine and fake job postings.
